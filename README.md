# Phase 1: Python Foundations  

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python projects from **Phase 1 of my AI Roadmap**.  
The goal of this phase is to build a strong foundation in Python by practicing syntax, loops, conditionals, functions, and simple problem-solving.

##  Projects  

### 1.Calculator  
**Description:**  
A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

**Skills Practiced:**  
- Functions in Python  
- Taking user input  
- Handling errors (like division by zero)

### 2.Guessing Game  
**Description:**  
A fun number-guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 100, and the player has 5 attempts to guess it. After each guess, the game provides hints to guide the player.  

**Features:**  
- Random number generation (`random` module)  
- Limited attempts (5 tries)  
- Hints for each guess (low/high)  
- Win/lose messages with the correct answer revealed if not guessed  

**Skills Practiced:**  
- Loops (`while`)  
- Conditionals (`if-elif-else`)  
- User input handling  
- Random number usage

### 3. Rule-based Chatbot  
**Description:**  
A simple text-based chatbot that responds to user input using predefined rules and keywords. The chatbot simulates a conversation by checking user input against conditions and providing fixed replies.  

**Features:**  
- Responds to greetings, farewells, and common questions  
- Provides multiple random responses for variety  
- Includes a simple **jokes feature** for extra personality  
- Exit option with natural phrases like `"bye"`, `"goodbye"`, `"ok bye"`  
- Fallback responses when input doesnâ€™t match any rule  

**Skills Practiced:**  
- String handling (`lower()`, keyword matching)  
- Conditionals (`if-elif-else`)  
- Loops (to keep the chatbot running until exit)  
- Randomized responses (`random.choice()`)
